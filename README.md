# Madhav-Store
Created Interactive Dashboard using PowerBI
Hi 

I hope you are having a great day.

Presenting my first ever PowerBI Dashboard analyzing Sales of Madhav Online Store 🏪 , With the help of PowerBI's intuitive and powerful data visualization tools, I was able to dive deep into our sales data and uncover key insights about our customers and products. By examining metrics like sales by order, category, sub-category, region, and time period.

Now let's talk about the objective, conclusions, and key takeaways that I've obtained from the analysis 📈 :
